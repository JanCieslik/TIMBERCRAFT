This project is a basic online shop front built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to view a list of products and manage a shopping cart. Originally integrated with Firebase for cart storage and authentication, the project has since been adapted for static website hosting on AWS S3, with plans to expand cloud integration using scalable cloud services like Amazon DynamoDB or AWS Lambda.

The application demonstrates fundamental JavaScript skills and a clear understanding of web architecture, including cloud hosting and public access configuration on AWS
